### SLAY THE MOLOCH game

Based on cookie clicker games, but much more educational, this game should offer a platform to create, explore and connect with Cohort VII. TL;DR: We are building a time wasting appreciation game with shitcoins valuable tokens and cool sprites and did i say tokens? and whatnot else. Sky is the limit.

#### Key Features

- Lively graphics to make the player forget that all about this is just number-go-up game

- Bajillion tokens available for players to mint

- Funny quotes should appear frequently over the tavern keepers head

- These kinds of games thrive on bajillion features. The more little bits and bobs we add the more fun it will be :P

### CohortView.eth

The cornerstone of the Hamsterverse, showcasing team projects through the unique Mad Libs/Viewmaster lens. The hamster narrator becomes the "host" of this show, connecting everything together. - So i guess this will involve us either making little comics or the tougher route of those animations.

### The Epic

Can defo flesh out our special hamster and his tale on a weekly basis by writing up relevant stories. Stories that capture what we learn on a weekly basis, and eventually leads to the hamster facing Moloch! Perhaps we can turn this into something more philosophical, perhaps keep it all lighthearted, and funny. So much we can do....

### Social Media Chronicles

The serialized "Adventures of the Raid Guild Hamster" unfolds alongside Cohortviewer.eth. Herein we're pretty much responsible to manage our chosen social media accounts and create content relevant to the raid guild as a whole to educate, and also shits & giggles Hamster stuff + showing off the rest of the lovely cohort and what we're all doing here/learning.

### Commemorative NFTs

Commemorative NFTs at the end of the cohort. These could be personalized hamster avatars reflecting individual members or even team-specific designs. This provides a lasting memento and a potential community-building tool.

### Expensive Message

Every message costs 2x more RGCVII than the previous one!When anyone posts after you, you double your money.
